**Project Title: Human Resources Dashboard using SQL and Power BI**

**Project Description:**

In this project, I have created a comprehensive Human Resources Dashboard utilizing SQL for data cleaning and aggregation, and Power BI for visualization. The primary objective of this project was to provide actionable insights and facilitate informed decision-making within the HR domain. By leveraging these technologies, I have successfully transformed raw HR data into a user-friendly, interactive dashboard that empowers stakeholders with valuable insights.
